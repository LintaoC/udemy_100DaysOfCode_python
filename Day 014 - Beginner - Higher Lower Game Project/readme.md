Angela programming tips:

0. Play the game 10 times 
1. Breakdown problem
2. Todo list - start with the easiest
3. Turn the problem into comments
4. Write code - Run code - Fix code
5. Next task


Task I identified:
- Create a function to pick, items in game data at random
- From the item picked, print the desciptions and country
- Ask user for is input
- Create a function to compare two items and return the one with higher follower
- Check if user input is right or wrong
--> Right Add one to the score. Pick a new item in game data. B --> A
--> Wrong, end the game. Print final score

main.py = my solution, as I did it.

main_with_game_function.py = my solution, tring to use a "game()" function, like the method of Angela in the previous lessons.

main_solution.py = Solution from Angela
